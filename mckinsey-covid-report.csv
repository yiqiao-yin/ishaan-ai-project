COVID-19 and jobs: 
Monitoring the US impact 
on people and places
A clearer picture is emerging of the sectors, regions, and 
demographic groups at risk across the United States.

1,"The spread of coronavirus  is leaving a wide swath 
of economic damage in its wake. Our initial analysis, 
conducted at the beginning of April, examined the 
impact at the state, national, and occupational level. 
We estimated that in the shutdown phase alone, up 
to 53 million US jobs were vulnerable—a term we 
use to encompass permanent layoffs, temporary 
furloughs, or reductions in hours and pay.
Since then, demand shocks have been reverberating 
through all sectors. Now that pandemic-related 
unemployment claims have been pouring in for 
several weeks, the losses associated with the initial 
shutdown are cascading into knock-on effects. 
While leisure and hospitality accounted for most 
of the earliest layoffs and furloughs, the share 
from industries such as retail trade, manufacturing, 
nonessential healthcare, and professional services 
has been growing. We estimate that up to 57 million 
US jobs are now vulnerable, including more and 
more white-collar positions.. By way of context, 
some 59 million jobs are at risk in the European 
Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, which 
have a considerably larger population. 
We find significant overlap between the workers 
who are vulnerable in the current downturn and 
those who hold jobs susceptible to automation in the 
future. In addition to the effects of technology, the 
crisis itself may create lasting changes in consumer 
behavior and health protocols. To put vulnerable 
workers on more promising and sustainable paths, 
the US response should incorporate a longer-term 
view about the resulting occupational shifts and the 
development of skills . 
Decisive action is critical. After every US recession 
since 1991, it has taken progressively longer for jobs 
to reappear. The United States did not regain the number of jobs it lost in the Great Recession until 
2014. Given the depths of the current downturn, the 
country cannot afford to let history repeat itself—
and it’s possible to make choices that will head off 
that outcome. But responding to the twin challenges 
of a public-health crisis and an economic downturn 
may require a new playbook, rapid innovation, 
learning, and adaptation.
More than 26 million Americans have 
applied for unemployment, but twice 
that number are vulnerable
About one in six US workers—more than 26 million 
Americans—filed for unemployment in the five 
weeks ending April 18. That number erases all of the 
net job gains since the Great Recession. 
In the five weeks from March 15 to April 18, initial 
unemployment claims surged across the country. 
Florida, Georgia, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, 
and Texas each had more than a million residents 
filing for benefits; in California, the number 
surpassed three million. Viewing these numbers 
as a share of the total workforce illustrates the 
magnitude of the downturn (Exhibit 1). In five states—
Hawaii, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and 
Rhode Island—a quarter or more of the workforce 
has applied for unemployment benefits. 
Unemployment claims offer only a partial picture 
of workforce dislocations. Our analysis shows that 
more than twice as many workers are vulnerable 
to reduced hours, pay cuts, and temporary unpaid 
leave. Moreover, unemployment claims will 
undoubtedly rise in the weeks ahead as states work 
through a backlog of claims and more businesses 
that initially tried to maintain payrolls resort to 
furloughs and layoffs.

3,"Job losses are rippling through 
multiple industries and occupations
An analysis of state-level data on initial 
unemployment claims shows that the earliest wave 
of job losses, in mid-March, disproportionately hit 
food service, entertainment, and accommodations. 
Subsequent weeks have seen a sharp pullback 
in consumer spending in most categories, 
leading to job losses in retail, business services, 
manufacturing, and non-essential healthcare  
(Exhibit 2).
Examining the week-by-week initial unemployment 
claims in specific states illustrates this pattern. In 
New York State, for example, most claims filed for 
the week ending March 21 came from leisure and 
hospitality, which accounts for just 10 percent of 
the state’s workforce. In later weeks, an increasing 
number of claims came from retail as well as 
professional and business services. In Michigan, 
leisure and hospitality accounted for 35 percent of 
the claims filed in the week ending March 21 but 12 
percent in the week ending March 28. Meanwhile, 
the share from the manufacturing sector tripled. 
Looking ahead, the loss of employment will 
likely continue to cascade. Strained budgets are 
beginning to force state and local governments to cut public-sector jobs. City governments from 
Cincinnati to Santa Barbara are already resorting 
to furloughs and layoffs. A drop in charitable giving 
is hitting nonprofits, and colleges are anticipating 
cutbacks. Consumers have been migrating to 
digital banking during the shutdown, so fewer bank 
employees may be needed in retail branches. 
Online job postings provide an early gauge of hiring 
trends in specific occupations. Data from Emsi, 
which consolidates data from more than 100,000 
websites, show that job postings have declined by 
roughly one million since February 2020—a drop 
of 16 percent.¹ The biggest percentage decline 
came in postings for oil and gas operators (a drop of 
56 percent), followed by food-machine operators, 
bakers, bellhops, auto-insurance appraisers, and 
parking-lot attendants (all of which declined by 
roughly 40 percent). 
By contrast, demand is spiking for some 
roles. Translators saw the greatest increase as 
hospitals added interpreters to treat non-English-
speaking COVID-19 patients. Other occupations 
experiencing a surge in hiring include respiratory 
therapists, general practitioners, psychiatrists, and 
epidemiologists (Exhibit 3).
1 These declines do not necessarily mean that fewer workers are needed in these occupations. Job listings also reflect turnover. In a downturn, 
people are reluctant to leave their jobs, so employers need to hire fewer people for typically high-turnover positions.

5,"Low-wage, part-time, and minority 
workers are the most likely to hold 
vulnerable jobs
While Americans of all backgrounds are feeling the 
economic pain, many of the newly unemployed in 
early March were part-time workers, young people, 
minorities, and women (Exhibit 4). 
Our initial analysis, published in early April, found 
that 86 percent of jobs that the pandemic has made 
vulnerable paid less than $40,000 a year. Part-time 
workers were disproportionately represented. But 
as demand has fallen in multiple industries, growing 
numbers of full-time and white-collar jobs are 
being affected. Our updated model finds that as of 
mid-April, 16 percent of workers earning more than $70,000 a year have become vulnerable  
(Exhibit 5). However, almost three-quarters of all 
vulnerable workers earn less than $40,000 a year.² 
Education: Workers without bachelor’s degrees 
are nearly twice as likely to hold vulnerable 
jobs.  In MGI’s research on automation in the US 
labor market, educational attainment emerged 
as the strongest demographic predictor of future 
displacement risk. Today the pandemic has put the 
educational divide in stark relief. Workers without 
bachelor’s degrees are twice as likely to hold jobs 
we classify as vulnerable. They account for 58 
percent of the US workforce but 82 percent of all 
vulnerable jobs. Overall job postings have declined, but there have been small increases in 
COVID-19-related occupations.
Note: Unidenti/f_ied occupations were removed from chart; only occupations with at least 500 job postings in February 2020 were an alyzed; 
names of occupations adjusted for clarity; occupations shown do not represent the full one-million decline.

7,"Race: Minorities are more likely to hold vulnerable 
jobs, especially in large cities.  The March 14 
household survey data from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) show that racial minorities make up 
20 percent of the labor force but 25 percent of the 
newly unemployed. This disparity may in part result 
from a difference in the ability to work from home. 
White workers are 37 percent more likely than their 
nonwhite counterparts to hold jobs that can be 
performed remotely.³ 
Race is an especially strong predictor of job 
vulnerability in many large cities where the people 
staffing retail shops, bars, and restaurants are 
disproportionately nonwhite. Nonwhite workers are 
28 percent more likely than white workers to hold 
vulnerable jobs in Honolulu, 29 percent more likely 
in Albuquerque, and 30 percent in Washington, DC. Age: Younger workers are 35 percent more likely to 
hold vulnerable jobs.  March BLS household survey 
data show that younger workers were especially 
likely to be let go by employers. Workers under the 
age of 35 make up 36 percent of the US labor force 
but 49 percent of the newly unemployed. In part, 
this may reflect their greater propensity to hold part-
time jobs and their lack of seniority. The generation 
that first entered the job market in the aftermath 
of the Great Recession is now going through its 
second “once in a lifetime” downturn.
Gender: Women sustained a majority of the initial 
job losses, but that may change going forward.  The 
earliest job losses have hit women harder than men. 
March enterprise survey data from the BLS found 
that women made up 59 percent of the initial jobs 
lost.⁴ This occurred in part because they account 
Part-time jobs held by women constitute more than half of the vulnerable jobs 
in leisure, hospitality, education, and health services.

8,"for just under two-thirds of employment in leisure 
and hospitality, retail, education, and health—areas 
that accounted for 80 percent of the job losses from 
February 15 to March 14.⁵ 
Many women were also vulnerable by virtue of 
their part-time status (Exhibit 6).⁶ Women hold 63 
percent of all part-time jobs, which are typically the 
first to be cut in any downturn. Part-time workers 
accounted for only 18 percent of the workforce in 
February but 46 percent of net new unemployment 
claims in March. 
However, the gender disparity in initial job losses 
may rebalance over time. Our model finds that men 
are 10 percent more likely than women to hold 
vulnerable jobs. Job losses were more limited in 
male-dominated sectors such as construction and 
manufacturing in March, but they may be harder 
hit as time goes on. These two sectors combined 
account for as many vulnerable jobs as retail. 
Employers and governments have 
multiple issues to solve 
The ultimate economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic will be partially determined by how 
effectively policy makers and business leaders can 
mitigate structural damage to the economy while 
containing the virus. While the situation is evolving 
rapidly, it is clear that supporting the workers 
and businesses that are losing income during the 
initial lockdown is a priority. Policy makers have 
created significant fiscal-relief programs to support 
workers and businesses; the challenge now is to 
operationalize those measures. But in this highly 
fluid environment, the public and private sectors 
alike will need to adapt and innovate, learn what 
works and what doesn’t, and adjust as they go.
The issues facing companies 
One of the lessons of the last downturn is that 
completely severing the relationship between 
employers and employees tends to lengthen unemployment. To the extent that companies can 
implement reduced hours, temporary furloughs, or 
creative job-sharing and redeployment programs 
instead of outright layoffs, the entire economy 
will be better positioned for a faster and stronger 
recovery. The Payroll Protection Program, for 
example, is meant to cover payroll costs so that 
small businesses can keep workers employed.⁷ 
When furloughs and layoffs are unavoidable, 
employers can take steps to help the newly 
unemployed land on their feet. Participating in 
digital platforms can help furloughed and laid-off 
workers connect with organizations that need 
temporary help to meet surging demand. Some 
companies that are downsizing are already forming 
direct partnerships with organizations that are hiring 
to help make these workforce transitions faster 
and more seamless. Furloughs can also provide 
a window for employees to develop the skills that 
employers envision needing in the future through 
online training. 
Many businesses have rapidly shifted to remote 
work. But as schools around the nation shut 
down, working mothers have had to take on more 
child care. In addition to federally mandated paid 
sick leave under the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act, companies can offer greater 
flexibility to support parents working from home. 
To prevent a worsening of gender disparities, it 
will be important for companies to take parenting 
responsibilities into account in the current 
environment.
As companies look ahead to an eventual reopening, 
they are thinking about how to operate safely, 
given the need to prevent wider outbreaks and 
build consumer confidence. This may involve 
reconfiguring shared office spaces, adding 
plexiglass screens between customers and frontline 
workers, acquiring adequate supplies of personal 
protective equipment (PPE), creating new health 
protocols, or shifting more work online. Companies 
5 Although demand for COVID-19–related healthcare has spiked, many medical facilities offering noncritical care have been temporarily closed. 
6 Part-time jobs based on US Department of Labor’s O*NET survey, which asks whether a typical work week for a given occupation involves less 
than 40 hours, exactly 40 hours, or more than 40 hours of work a week. Occupations that typically involve less than 40 hours of work a week are 
regarded as part time.
7 Germany’s Kuzarbeit (short-time-work) program partially subsidizes wages for companies that need to reduce the number of hours employees 
work. The number of applications to this program has soared since early March. See “Safeguarding Europe’s livelihoods: Mitigating the 
employment impact of COVID-19,” April 2020, McKinsey.com.

5. What are some of the measures that companies are taking to prevent wider outbreaks?","1. The three most vulnerable sectors for job loss are leisure and hospitality, retail, education, and health.
2. The gender disparity in initial job losses may rebalance over time. Men are 10 percent more likely than women to hold vulnerable jobs.
3. Employers can take steps to help the newly unemployed land on their feet, such as participating in digital platforms, forming direct partnerships with organizations that are hiring, and offering greater flexibility to support parents working from home.
4. Companies are thinking about how to operate safely, given the need to prevent wider outbreaks and build consumer confidence. This may involve reconfiguring shared office spaces, adding plexiglass screens between customers and frontline workers, acquiring adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), creating new health protocols, or shifting more work online.

to improve the comfort level of consumers, such as 
limiting density in commercial spaces, conducting 
temperature checks, and using contactless 
payment and pickup methods. The current crisis is 
forcing innovation on the fly, so employers can also 
reimagine workplaces and workflows. 
The issues facing policy makers 
The deluge of unemployment claims has created 
significant delays for people who urgently need 
money in their pockets. A number of states have 
reduced the backlog by adding staff or upgrading 
digital processing. If shutdowns need to be 
prolonged to protect public health, policy makers 
may need to consider extending this lifeline. 
Although freelancers and gig workers are now 
eligible for unemployment, many have found it 
difficult to navigate application processes that were 
not developed with their situations in mind. States 
including Massachusetts are trying to address 
this problem by setting up portals specifically for 
independent workers. 
To supplement federal loan programs, many states 
are offering small businesses no- or low-interest 
emergency bridge loans or grants. Similar programs 
have been rolled out at the city level in places such 
as Chicago, Oklahoma City, and San Francisco. 
A number of cities and states have paused both 
residential and commercial evictions. California’s 
state government brought together a consortium of 
major lenders to offer forms of relief such as grace 
periods on mortgage payments. 
State workforce agencies may also choose to 
design new education and training programs with 
the specific goal of helping unemployed workers 
without college degrees increase their employability when the economy reopens—and for the longer 
term as well. This could involve courses for high-
school-equivalency certificates, remedial courses 
in literacy and numeracy, and online community-
college programs that teach specialized skills 
required for high-demand jobs (such as nursing). 
To reopen economies safely, government officials 
can work collaboratively with employers to set 
standards for safe workplaces and consumer 
protocols, as well as issues such as acquiring 
enough PPE for industries to operate. Communities   
need large-scale systems for testing and contact 
tracing. Addressing such pandemic-related needs 
can create work for unemployed Americans. 
California is taking a similar approach with a new 
program that will use funding from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to pay restaurants 
to provide home-meal deliveries to seniors in 
need. Public health and economic recovery are 
intertwined, and they can be addressed in tandem.
The pandemic is accelerating structural shifts in 
the economy that were already underway, such 
as using digital channels to reach consumers, 
automating operations, and allowing people to 
work remotely from home. Moreover, some shifts 
in consumer behavior and demand for new types 
of work may outlast the current public health crisis. 
Preparing for the “future of work” has gone from 
a distant hypothetical to a very immediate priority. 
Tens of millions of workers need support not only 
to get through today’s challenges but also to put 
themselves on a better footing for the future. In the 
months ahead, we will continue with our ongoing 
research to track these trends.
